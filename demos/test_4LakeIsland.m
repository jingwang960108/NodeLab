%% test_4LakeIsland
% This test generates non-uniform nodes inside a arbitrary 
% Lake-shaped domain having a small island inside - within a 
% bounding box (100.0 145.0)x(634.0 799.0). 
% The node-density is highest near the boundary. In this test, the
% boundary points have been used as the control-points: 'ctps'
